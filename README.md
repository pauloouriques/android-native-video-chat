Android Native Video Chat
=========================

## Adding your signaling server URL:
- Replace the entry <signaling-server-url> located in the file webrtc/SignallingClient with the your signaling server absolute URL (remember to include the http or https).


## Running the app:
- Build 2 apps in 2 different devices;
- In order to pass trough some NATs you may have to use Stun/Turn servers;
- Open the app in both devices and wait for the signaling process to establish a peer-2-peer connection;
